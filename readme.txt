Make it easy for South African WordPress sites to add the COVID-19 banner as required by the South African government.

== Description ==

All .za domain names are required by the South African Government to have a way to direct people to a legitimate source of information regarding COVID-19.

The relevant Government Gazette, number 43164, is available to be downloaded from the Government Printing Works (GPW) as a PDF.

The requirement for websites to link to the government COVID-19 website is set out in paragraph 5.1.4.
